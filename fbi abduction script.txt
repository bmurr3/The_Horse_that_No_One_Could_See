...PSST!


Hey, you the guy investigating the disappearances?
	~YES, I am. You are? (to #1)

	~No, I am not.
		Okay, tell me if you find him. (Return to street)

	~Get off me creep!
		Fine! I didn't want your help anyway (Return to street)

#1
-My name is Dennis. I might have something that will help you. 

-I was going for a walk down in the park late at night cause I couldn't sleep and I hear something. It sounded like a machine screeching and then hoofbeats.

-I thought nothing of it at first but then a couple nights later the same thing happened. So I decided to stake it out.
	~What did you find?
		-I waited and at first there was nothing....	 Then around 11PM I heard the same sound again. 
		-I looked around with my night vision goggles to try and get a view of what it was.
		-It looked like a mechanical horse! It looked right at me.
		-It looked at me and started to charge. I ran away and tripped into a ditch. It ran over the top of me and when I got up I saw some guys wandering around in the forest with weird gadgets talking about some experiment.

			~Are you stupid?
				-No. Not at all. Maybe a little. (Return to questions, with this option grayed out)
			~Are you crazy?
				-No, but I feel like it. I tried talking to the police but...
					~They blew you off right? (Go to #A)
						
					~They didn't believe you? (Go to #B)
		

#A
-Yeah. They thought I was crazy and wanted to arrest me. 
~I didn't want to tell them I had heard of this before.
-You mean, you have seen this before?
~Yes, I have been traveling around investigating this after someone brought it up to me. (Shows a notebook to Dennis)
- Wow, I cant believe it. This looks exactly like what I saw!
~This was a sketch based on numerous accounts I had investigated previously
~The sound and attacks are also common. You were lucky. Most were in groups and some didn't make it out alive.
-I had no idea. I guess I am a little stupid. Is there anything I can do?
~There are a few theories about who made it. Aliens. The Russians. The Chinese. Maybe even the French. No more clues than what we have as to who it is.
-Can I help you stake it out?
	~Yes

	~No, It's too dangerous. I must face it alone.
