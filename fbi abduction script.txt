...PSST!


Hey, you the guy investigating the disappearances?
	~YES, I am. You are? (to #1)

	~No, I am not.
		Okay, tell me if you find him. (Return to street)

	~Get off me creep!
		Fine! I didn't want your help anyway (Return to street)

#1
-My name is Dennis. I might have something that will help you. 

-I was going for a walk down in the park late at night cause I couldn't sleep and I hear something. It sounded like a horse whinnying and then hoofbeats.

-I thought nothing of it at first but then a couple nights later the same thing happened. So I decided to stake it out.
	~What did you find?
		-I waited and at first there was nothing....	 Then around 11PM I heard the same sound again. 
		-I looked around with my night vision goggles to try and get a view of what it was.
		-It was a horse! It began to approach me slowly and pretty soon it was right on top of me!
		-It looked right at me and started to attack. I tried to run away and fell into a ditch. It ran over the top of me and disappeared.
			~Are you stupid?
				-No. Not at all. Maybe a little. (Return to questions, with this option grayed out)
			~Are you crazy?
				-No, but I feel like it. I tried talking to the police but...
					~They blew you off right? (Go to #A)
						
					~They didn't believe you? (Go to #B)
		

#A
-Yeah. They thought I was crazy and wanted to arrest me.
~Was there anything else unusual?
-When I got up I saw some guys wandering around in the forest with weird gadgets talking about some experiment. Does that fit the bill?
~Just as I expected.
-You mean, you have seen this before?
~Yes, I have been traveling around investigating this after someone brought it up to me. (Shows a notebook to Dennis)
- Wow, I cant believe it. This looks exactly like what I saw!
~This was a sketch based on numerous accounts I had investigated previously
~The sound and attacks are also common. You were lucky. Most were in groups and some didn't make it out alive.
-I had no idea. I guess I am a little stupid. Is there anything I can do?
~There are a few theories about who made it. Aliens. The Russians. The Chinese. Maybe even the French. No more clues than what we have as to who it is.

	
#B
-They didn't even want to listen to me. Horses are so common around here.
~Can you give me a description?
-It was a horse
~Alright, how tall?
-About 18 hands?
~18, wow. That's a tall horse. How did you measure?
-I Looked at the position of his head in relation to a couple branches above him as I was crawling away.
~You used parallax measurement?
-You don't?
~ Moving on. Any distinct markings? Hair color?
-He was brown, with a white streak down his chest. His hooves were well trimmed.
~Eye color?
-Black, soulless, and beady. Like a horse's eyes.
~And his mane was?
-Long and flowing. Like a flock of goats down a mountainside.
~Like this? (Shows crude drawing of horse)
-Yeah. What are you going to do now?
	~I'll continue my investigation elsewhere. I'm going back to town. (To street)
		-Okay, Good luck!
	~I want to see the scene of the attack. Can you show me? (To forest)
